## Methods & Data

Due: See [Course Calendar](../README.md)

For this phase of your project, you will complete the following assignments.
1. Presentation
2. Thesis

3. Presentation: Methods & Data. You will prepare a brief presentation summarizing your
methods and data. The presentation should be 2-5 minutes and no more than 3 presentation
slides (not including a “works cited” slide). The presentation will be followed by 5-10
minutes of questions and discussion with the class. 

1. Thesis: Methods This assignment entails the completion and submission of three
components:
    1. Methods & Data
    2. Data Appendix
    3. Data summary code file.

### Methods and Data sections

Methods & Data. The Methods & Data section should include subsections that describe
your model specification as well as data and summary statistics.

#### Methods

- The Methods section should specify your regression equation; classify explanatory
variables as variables of interest or controls; and indicate the expected sign of the
coefficients of the variables of interest. This section should be brief, but provide all
relevant information (2-3 pages).
- Precisely define the dependent variable and specify (write out) your regression
equation. Use the Word equation editor to produce a presentable equation.
Provide justification for your functional form and motivation for any interacted or
quadratic terms.
- Give each variable a transparent name that is clear, but not too long. This should
be the same variable name used in your programming language/R.
- Define all the explanatory variables included in your regression equation. Devote
most of this section to your variables of interest. For all dummy variables, state
the omitted condition. Refer the reader back to variable definitions or summary
statistics table when necessary. Avoid redundancies.
- Indicate the expected sign for each regression coefficient -- positive, negative, or
ambiguous -- and provide a brief explanation supporting your expectation. Focus
primarily on your variables of interest and on the most critical (in terms of
avoiding omitted variable bias) control variables. You do not need to discuss
expectations for all control variables.
