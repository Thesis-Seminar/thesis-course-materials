# Reducing empirical chaos

## Sad story

- Once upon a time there was a boy who was writing a job market paper on unemployment insurance during the pandemic

- This boy presented the findings a half dozen times, spoke to the media some, and generally thought he had cool results

- Several people suggested he look at a handful of other outcome series and try changing his analysis unit frequency from monthly to weekly

- He also knew that he needed to restrict his sample to reduce noise

---
# The horror!

- But then after making these changes and re-running his code that took two days, his new sample dropped by 50 percent!
- He was, understandably, terrified.
- The young boy spent a week looking for the fix weeding through six different versions of the .do, .R, .dta, .csv, .sh, .py files with suffixes like *_v1* and *_test* and *_test2* and *_final_I_swear* and *_okay_i_lied*
- Finally he discovered the phrase:

``` r
df %&gt;% filter(insample_new==0)
```
**instead of**

``` r
df %&gt;% filter(insample_new==1)
```
- The boy was very frustrated and decided to work on these slides while re-running his code.

- Minimize these struggles through Clean Code and a reproducible workflow

# What is Clean Code?

.hi[Clean Code:] Code that is easy to understand, easy to modify, and hence easy to debug

--

#### Clean code advances scientific progress

- Good science uses careful observations to iteratively test hypotheses/make predictions

- Scientific progress is impeded if

    - mistaken previous results are erroneously given authority
    - previous hypothesis tests are not reproducible
    - previous methods and results are not transparent

- Thus, for science that involves computer code, clean code is a must

- Reduces "the influence of hidden researcher decisions" (Huntington-Klein et al. 2021)

--

#### Clean code increases personal/team sanity

- You will always make a mistake while coding -- what makes good programmers great is their ability to identify and correct mistakes 

- Clean code makes it easier to identify and correct mistakes

- Saves you stress in the long-run and makes your collaborative relationships more pleasant

---
# Why clean code is under-produced

- If clean code is so beneficial and important, why isn't there more of it?

--

1. .hi[Competitive pressure] to produce research/products as quickly as possible

2. .hi[End user] (journal editor, reviewer, reader, dean) .hi[doesn't care what the code looks like], just that the product works

3. In the moment, clean code .hi[takes longer to produce] while seemingly conferring no benefit

---
# How does one produce clean code?

1. Organization of data and files

2. Version Control&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

3. Automation

4. Abstraction

5. Documentation

6. Time / task management

7. Test-driven development (unit testing, profiling, refactoring)

8. Pair programming

.footnote[&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Handled in Git lecture notes.]

name: organization
# 1a. File organization

1. Separate directories by function

2. Separate files into inputs and outputs

3. Make directories portable

- To see how professionals do this, check out the source code for R's [dplyr](https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr) package

    - There are separate directories for source code (`/src`), documentation (`/man`), code tests (`/test`), data (`/data`), examples (`/vignettes`), and more

- When you use version control, it forces you to make directories portable (otherwise a collaborator will not be able to run your code)

    - Use __relative__ file paths, not absolute file paths

---
# Don't be like this

# What is a working directory?

- All the files on your computer are organized in directories or folders

- When you are running a script, you are working from a particular directory
  - This is *not necessarily* the directory where the script is located
  - Your computer looks for `my_data.csv` in this directory when you execute `read.csv('my_data.csv')`
  - If that file is not in that directory, you will get a `FileNotFound` error
  - In **R**, you can see what directory you are in using the `getwd()` function
    - It is also above the console in RStudio
    - You can double click the `.Rproj` file to set the working directory to the root of the project
    - You can also change your working directory using the `setwd()` function (avoid this within scripts)


``` r
getwd()
```

```
## [1] "c:/Users/kgcsp/OneDrive/Documents/Education/senior-thesis/thesis-course-materials/lecture/04-replication"
```

``` r
setwd('lecture/04-replication')
```

---
# What is a directory path?

A path defines the location of a file or directory in a file system tree. If I navigate to this file in my computer, it is: 

`C:\Users\kgcsp\OneDrive\Documents\Education\senior-thesis\thesis-course-materials\lecture\04-replication\04-replication.Rmd`&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

The name separates folders that chart the path from the .hi[root] to the file
  - .hi[root]: the start of the file system tree (above that is `C:\`)
  - Each folder along the tree is separated by a `\` or `/`

This is called an .hi[absolute path]:
  - It is long, hard to remember, and not portable across computers

.hi[Relative paths] solve a lot of this:
  - The path to a file or directory starting from the current working directory
  - If my working directory is `/thesis-course-materials`, then I can write `lecture\04-replication\04-replication.Rmd`
  - **This is portable**: if you have a copy of the project folder, you can run the code

.footnote[&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; This is a Windows path, Mac and Linux paths use `/` instead of `\`. See appendix for slides on how to move between them using `..`]

---
# How I organize research projects

- One project = one repository/folder
- Each of you should turn in your thesis in a repository organized by folder
- One potential organizational schema:
    1. `data` for all data files
        a. `raw` for raw data files
        b. `clean` or `work` for cleaned data files
        c. `temp` for temporary data files
    2. `code` for all code files, and sometimes:
        a. `code/analysis` for code files that build/clean code
        a. `code/build` for code files that do analysis
    3. `output` for all output files
        a. `output/figures` for code files that make figures
        b. `output/tables` for code files that make tables
    4. `literature` or `articles` for all relevant literature
    5. `writing` for all writing files
        a. `writing/notes` for notes
        b. `writing/drafts` for drafts
        c. `writing/edits` for edits
    6. `presentations` for all presentations
        a. `presentations/slides` for slides
        b. `presentations/notes` for notes
- I'll further more or less as needed
- See [the `thesis_sample` folder](https://github.com/Bates-ECON456-Thesis-Seminar/thesis-sample) on GitHub (in the same folder as this lecture) as an example

---
# On my computer

![Directory structure](pics/directory_structure.png)

---
# What is the value of directories?

- All of the files in a directory are related to each other

- Can reference a file within the `data/raw` folder, from the `code/build` folder without writing out the full path

- Then you do not need to worry about shifting around directories 

- Reduces headaches of reproducing results with someone else's code

---

# 1b. Data organization

- The key idea is to practice .hi[relational data base management]

- A relational database consists of many smaller data sets

- Each data set is tabular and has a unique, non-missing key

- Data sets "relate" to each other based on these keys

- You can implement these practices in any modern statistical analysis software (R, Stata, SAS, Python, Julia, SQL, ...)

- Gentzkow &amp; Shapiro recommend not merging data sets until as far into your code pipeline as possible

name: automation
# 3. Automation

- Gentzkow &amp; Shapiro's two rules for automation:

1. Automate everything that can be automated

2. Write a single script that executes all code from beginning to end

- There are two reasons automation is so important

    - Reproducibility (helps with debugging and revisions)

    - Efficiency (having a code base saves you time in the future)

- All data wrangling, cleaning, and analysis should be automated

- If the data download can be automated, automate it (if not document instructions)

---
# Write modular code

- Code should be broken into small, modular scripts

- Each script should do one thing and one thing only (e.g. one input, one output)

    - Taking in a raw file and returning a cleaned version
    - Taking in two files and merging them
    - Taking in a cleaned file and returning a figure

- Think of it like an essay: 
  - intro paragraph =/= body paragraph 1 =/= ... =/= conclusion
  - a script that cleans data =/= a script that merges data =/= a script that analyzes data
  
- Like essays revisions, modular code makes it easier to debug and revise

#### Have a main script that runs all scripts in order

- A single script that shows the sequence of steps, i.e. "shows your work"
  - This script will run modular scripts in sequence to exactly reproduce your analysis

- You will rarely run it all at once, but it will be a nice way to organize your thoughts

- A benefit of a well-organized directory: easily see what scripts you need to run in what order

- In R, use `source('rscript.R')` to run a script from one script

- A main script could be a `.Rmd`, a `.R`, a `.sh`, a `.py`, a `.do` etc.

# What's a housekeeping file?

A housekeeping file .hi[automates] several tasks and goes at the start of every file in your project

1. Load packages/ssc install packages

2. Save strings of path directories to reference throughout script&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;
  - If a folder name changes, you only need to change it in one place in your code
  - Use strings to reference files in other scripts `read.csv(file.path(data_raw,'my_data.csv'))` or in stata `use "$data_raw/my_data.dta"`

3. Automate creation of directories

Can be done in any language, but I provide examplse in `R` and [Stata](housekeeping.do)

.footnote[&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Alternatives to `file.path()` include `paste` and `here()`. Check [appendix example](#here) for more information.]

name: abstraction
# 4. Abstraction

- .hi[Abstraction:] "reducing the complexity of something by hiding unnecessary details from the user" 

- e.g. A dishwasher. I mainly need to know how to load it, put in soap, and press start. I don't need to understand the electrical wiring or plumbing.

- In programming, abstraction is usually handled with functions

- Abstraction is usually a good thing

- But it you can go too far: overly abstract code can be "impenetrable" and difficult to modify or debug

#### Gentzkow &amp; Shapiro give three rules for abstraction:

1. Abstract to eliminate redundancy

2. Abstract to improve clarity

3. Otherwise, don't abstract

- In the context of R, abstraction means:
  - Write functions
  - Name your objects sensibly

---

# Abstract to eliminate redundancy

- Sometimes you might find yourself repeating lines of code to accomplish a task


``` r
# Downloading a sequence of files from 2004 to 2020 gets tedious
download.file('https://data.nber.org/tax-stats/zipcode/2020/zipcode2020.zip',destfile=paste0(data_dir,'zipcode2020.zip',sep='/'))
download.file('https://data.nber.org/tax-stats/zipcode/2019/zipcode2019.zip',destfile=paste0(data_dir,'zipcode2019.zip',sep='/'))
download.file('https://data.nber.org/tax-stats/zipcode/2019/zipcode2019.zip',destfile=paste0(data_dir,'zipcode2018.zip',sep='/'))
# etc.
```

Notice any problems?


``` r
# Downloading a sequence of files from 20 wih a loop
lapply(2004:2020,function(y) {
    download.file(paste0('https://data.nber.org/tax-stats/zipcode/',y,'/zipcode',y,'.zip'),destfile=paste0(data_dir,'zipcode',y,'.zip',sep='/'))
})
```

- We'll learn more about iteration/for loops/appy statements later

- There are many forms of redundancy that can be eliminated with abstraction beyond iteration

---
# Abstract to improve clarity

Say you want to round a number to the nearest of different integers: 

1. Divide the number by there base integer
2. Round the result to the nearest whole number
3. Multiply by the base integer

I start coding and copy and paste the code for each integer:


``` r
rounded_157_nearest_5 &lt;- round(157/5)*5
rounded_157_nearest_7 &lt;- round(157/5)*7
```

--

Notice a problem? 

--

Why not abstract with a function?


``` r
round_to_nearest &lt;- function(x,base=5) {
    return(round(x/base)*base)
}

rounded_157_nearest_5 &lt;- round_to_nearest(157,base=5)
rounded_157_nearest_7 &lt;- round_to_nearest(157,base=7)
```

The second approach is easier to read and understand what the code is doing!

---
# Otherwise, don't abstract

1. Write/use functions for tasks that are repeated
2. Write thoughtful variable names (e.g. `x100, x101` versus `household_income`, `household_size`)

- If we're only doing it once in our script, then it may not make sense to use the function version

- This discussion points out that it can be difficult to know if one has reached the optimal level of abstraction

- As you're starting out programming, I would advise doing almost everything inside of a function (i.e. err on the side of over-abstraction when starting out)
  - And look for opportunities to loop (or use apply functions)

---
name: documentation
# 5. Documentation

Documentation gives sufficient information to replicate work, but not so much that it is overwhelming&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

### Rules for documentation

1. Don't write documentation you will not maintain

2. Code should be self-documenting

- Generally speaking, commented code is helpful

- However, sometimes it can be harmful if, e.g. code comments contain dynamic information

- It may not be helpful to have to rewrite comments every time you change the code

- Code can be "self-documenting" by naming functions and variables thoughtfully

.footnote[&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Anyone who has ever built IKEA furniture knows this all too well]

#### Documentation in R

- .hi[R Help System:] access using `?function_name`

- .hi[Package vignettes:] access using `vignette("vignette_name")`

- .hi[Cheatsheets:] access at [Posit Cheatsheets](https://posit.co/resources/cheatsheets/)

---
# A README is documentation 

- A README gives high-level information about the repository or data file:
  - This repository contains code that does X task
  - Simple use case: use this repository to replicate paper X in journal Y

- Onboarding instructions:
  - Add your name to this file in repository folder `the/folder/file.md`
  - Fork the repository and pull request changes
  - Configure your computer settings in this way to run this project
  - Guidelines/rules for contributing to the project

- Licensing information:
  - You can just take this code!
  - This is proprietary and we will sue you if you haven't paid us

- Dependencies:
  - To use this code or package or data_dir download packages `X`, `Y`, `Z`

- Changelog (short narrative commit history):
  - 9/23/2023 - KGC - added function `X` to do `Y`

---
name: time-task
# 6. Time and task management

### Time management

- Time management is key to writing clean code&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

- It is foolish to think that one can write clean code in a strained mental state

- Code written when you are groggy, overly anxious, or distracted will come back to bite you

- Schedule long blocks of time (1.5 hours - 3 hours) to work on coding where you eliminate distractions (email, social media, etc.)

- Stop coding when you feel that your focus or energy is dissipating

.footnote[&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Your professor needs this lecture too]

### Task management

- When collaborating on code, avoid email or Slack threads to discuss coding tasks

- Rather, use a task management system that has dedicated messages for a particular point of discussion (bug in the code, feature to develop, etc.)

- I use GitHub issues and milestones for all of my coding projects including [developing this class](https://github.com/orgs/big-data-and-economics/projects/2)

---
name: test-driven
# 7. Test-driven development

- The only way to know that your code works is to test it!

- Test-driven development (TDD) consists of a suite of tools for writing code that can be automatically tested

- Simplest test is to check if the code gives you the output you expected
  - Whenever you make a change, check it against the output you expect
  - Ideally, check against a small example so it runs fast and is easy to confirm

- What if the code takes too long to check completely? Meet .hi[unit tests]

- .hi[Unit testing] is nearly universally used in professional software development

---
# Unit testing

- Unit tests are scripts that check that a piece of code does everything it is supposed to do

- When professionals write code, they also write unit tests for that code at the same time

- If code doesn't pass tests, then bugs are caught immediately

- R's [dplyr package](https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr) shows that all unit tests are passing and that tests cover 91% of the code base

- [testthat](https://testthat.r-lib.org/) is a nice step-by-step guide for doing this in R (I use it to autograde exercises)

### Assertions

- Assert statements are extremely useful for basic unit tests
- They exist in every langage
- In R it is called stopifnot()


``` r
x &lt;- TRUE
stopifnot(x)

y &lt;- FALSE
stopifnot(y)
```

```
## Error: y is not TRUE
```
---

# 8. Pair programming - work with a buddy

- An essential part of clean code is reviewing code

- An excellent way to review code is to do so at the time of writing

- .hi[Pair programming] involves sitting two programmers at one computer

- One programmer does the writing while the other reviews

- This is a great way to spot silly typos and other issues that would extend development time

- It's also a great way to quickly refactor code at the start

- .hi[I strongly encourage you to do pair programming on problem sets in this course!]
